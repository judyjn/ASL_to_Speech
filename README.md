# ASL_to_Speech
Sign Language is a mode of communication used by differntly abled people. There are different forms for sign languages such as American Sign Language(ASL), Indian Sign Language etc. .With this work, we expect to find a solution to bridge the communication barrier between sign language users and others.

This project dectects ASL alphabets using SSD MobileNet in real time. The output image is then used to obtain audio output in real time using Pytesseract and Python text to speech Library.
